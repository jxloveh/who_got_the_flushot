# Who got the flushot?
An analysis of who have received the flu vaccination using BRFSS survey data of 2016-2018

## Introduction
There are a fair number of people who refuse to receive flu vaccination every year. The flu vaccine this year (2019) was brought up as a big issue because it did not match the circulating fl so well this flu season. I got the flu shot as I personally thought yearly vaccination was still worth getting. At the same time, I have grown interested in who tend to receive yearly flu vaccinations.

I also want to see if there is any relationship between "always" wearing seat belts while driving a car and getting yearly flu vaccination--if not always wearing seat belts could be consider as an indicator of people being careless and not taking care of themselves as they should be.
